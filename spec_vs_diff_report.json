  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of requirements across REQ-83 through REQ-89. Key files are added (ServiceManagementPage.tsx, ManagedServiceFormDialog.tsx, ManagedServicePreviewModal.tsx) and modified (backend/main.mo, useQueries.ts, App.tsx). However, the SidebarNav.tsx file is not shown as modified, so the sidebar navigation link for REQ-89 cannot be confirmed. Several other details are unverifiable due to file truncation but appear largely implemented.",

      "reason": "The diff does not include any modification to frontend/src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx. The file is listed neither as added nor modified, so the sidebar navigation link cannot be confirmed as implemented.",
