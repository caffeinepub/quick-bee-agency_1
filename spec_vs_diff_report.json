  "summary": "The diff modifies three files: AutomationPage.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. AutomationPage.tsx is rewritten to read toggle state from AIConfigContext and call dedicated setters. However, the diff does not include changes to AIConfigContext.tsx or useAutomationTriggers.ts, meaning REQ-78 and REQ-79 cannot be verified as implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-78",
      "requirement": "Audit frontend/src/contexts/AIConfigContext.tsx to define all five boolean toggle fields in the context type, initialize them from localStorage on mount, persist changes to localStorage, and expose dedicated setters for each toggle.",
      "reason": "No changes to frontend/src/contexts/AIConfigContext.tsx appear in the diff. The file is not listed as modified or added, so there is no evidence that the five toggle fields were added to the type, initialized from localStorage, or that dedicated setters were exposed.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-79",
      "requirement": "Audit frontend/src/hooks/useAutomationTriggers.ts so each trigger function reads the corresponding toggle from AIConfigContext and returns early when OFF, fires a POST with correct headers when ON, shows toast on failure, and logs every attempt in WebhookLogContext.",
      "reason": "No changes to frontend/src/hooks/useAutomationTriggers.ts appear in the diff. The file is not listed as modified or added, so none of the required guard logic, header configuration, toast error display, or WebhookLogContext logging can be confirmed.",
