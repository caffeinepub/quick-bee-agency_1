      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) for data migration",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention data migration infrastructure or migration modules. While the constraint mentions 'Existing services are migrated to include null values,' this likely refers to backward compatibility in the data model, not a separate migration module.",
