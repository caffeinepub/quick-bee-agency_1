      "featureTitle": "Rewrite frontend/src/pages/AutomationPage.tsx so every toggle — WhatsApp Auto-Reply, Proposal Auto-Send, Lead Follow-Up Sequences, Payment Confirmation, and Project Onboarding — reads its current ON/OFF state directly from AIConfigContext (the localStorage-backed centralized config store) and writes the updated toggle state back to AIConfigContext when clicked. The toggle UI must reflect the persisted value on initial render, after page navigation, and after a full app reload. When a toggle is OFF, its corresponding automation must not fire any webhook calls, API calls, or UI triggers. When a toggle is ON, the automation is active and fires on its designated trigger condition.",
